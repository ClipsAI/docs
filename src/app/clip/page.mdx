# Clip

As the name suggests, contacts are a core part of Protocol â€” the very reason Protocol exists is so you can have secure conversations with your contacts. On this page, we'll dive into the different contact endpoints you can use to manage contacts programmatically. We'll look at how to query, create, update, and delete contacts. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Clip Class

The contact model contains all the information about your contacts, such as their username, avatar, and phone number. It also contains a reference to the conversation between you and the contact and information about when they were last active on Protocol.
